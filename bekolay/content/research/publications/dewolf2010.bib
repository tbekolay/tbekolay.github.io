  abstract = {This paper presents the dynamic scaling technique (DST), a method for control in large environments that dramatically reduces the resources required to achieve highly accurate movements. The DST uses a low resolution representation of the environment to calculate an initial approximately optimal trajectory and refines the control signal as the target is neared. Simulation results are presented and the effect of representation resolution on accuracy and computational efficiency is analyzed.},

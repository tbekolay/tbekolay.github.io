  abstract = {This thesis examines the neurobiological components of the motor control system and relates it to current control theory in order to develop a novel framework for models of motor control in the brain. The presented framework is called the Neural Optimal Control Hierarchy (NOCH). A method of accounting for low level system dynamics with a Linear Bellman Controller (LBC) on top of a hierarchy is presented, as well as a dynamic scaling technique for LBCs that drastically reduces the computational power and storage requirements of the system. These contributions to LBC theory allow for low cost, high-precision control of movements in large environments without exceeding the biological constraints of the motor control system.},

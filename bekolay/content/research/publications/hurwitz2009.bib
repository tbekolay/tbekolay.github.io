  abstract = {The paper details an NEF model of bird song production and recognition. The model neurons and overall neural structure are taken from current research on the actual neuroanatomy of the zebra finch. While the model is simplified to songs of at most three notes, it illustrates that both sequence production (easy) and sequence recognition (hard) can be constructed in NEF. Furthermore, the model explains why specific types of neurons might be seen in the actual bird song-specific regions.},
